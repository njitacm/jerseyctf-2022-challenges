# rarity

## Challenge Text
* With three belonging to a respective company, there is only a two-digit number amount of this entity left in the world. There is one near this picture... how close can you get to it?
* The flag format is the coordinates in decimal degrees notation, for example: `jctf{-65.91374,-10.81140}`

## Hint
* Aren't sub sandwiches great?

## Solution
* Note the **330** area code in the bottom right corner of the picture which is in the Akron, Ohio area.
* Based on the hint of sub sandwiches, this could point towards Blimpie Sub Sandwiches, and Blimp can be taken from this which is the entity being discussed. Alternatively, research on the provided rarity numbers + Akron can lead to this conclusion as well.
* Goodyear Tires owns 3 blimps in the United States, and the 1 in Ohio is located by Wingfoot Lake. Open Google Maps and drag/drop Pegman (the person icon) to the spot closest to The Hangar. 
* Click to go up to the gates and note the coordinates in the URL.
* Flag: `jctf{41.019753,-81.3621151}`
