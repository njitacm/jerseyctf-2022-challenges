## Challenge Text
* On the first day of the job, a new cryptography intern is insisting to upper management that he developed a new encryption algorithm for the company to use for sensitive emails and should get a raise. This seems too good to be true... are you able to prove the intern wrong by decrypting it?

* Here's an example of an encrypted email message using the intern's algorithm:
`amN0Znt0UllfQUVTX0lOc1QzQGR9`

## Hint
* What are some differences between encryption, encoding, and hashing?

## Solution
* Recognize the usage of Base64 encoding and copy the text into a Base64 decoder:
* Flag: `jctf{tRY_AES_INsT3@d}`
