## Challenge Text
* The fishing net caught plenty of herrings, but the flag is nowhere to be found! Try to find the flag within the pile of fish.

## Hint
* How do you hide an image within an image?

## Solution
* Use an image steganography decoder like this - https://incoherency.co.uk/image-steganography/
* Select **Unhide image**, upload the image, and use the slider to extract the lowest 2 bits for the hidden image.  
* Flag: `jctf{1_l0v3_h3rr1n65}`
