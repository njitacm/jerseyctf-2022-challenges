# apache-logs

## Challenge Text
* An apache log file that contains recent traffic was pulled from a web server. There is suspicion that an external host was able to access a sensitive file accidentally placed in one of the company website's directories. Someone's getting fired... 
* Identify the source IP address that was able to access the file by using the flag format: jctf{IP address}

## Solution
* Query through the web traffic for a connection by searching for a HTTP 200 OK success status response code. All 404's can be ignored.
* Identify the accessed sensitive file that was accidentally placed in the website's temporary (tmp) folder - "https://www.davisbank.com/tmp/bankrecords.pdf"
* Identify the source IP address of the connection - jctf{76.190.52.148}

Log file was generated by https://github.com/kiritbasu/Fake-Apache-Log-Generator

## Hint
* Which directory types should sensitive files not be placed in?
